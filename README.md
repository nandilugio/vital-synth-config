# Vital Synth - Patches and config

Patches and other config for the [Vital Synthesizer](https://vital.audio/), created by [Matt Tytel](https://tytel.org/). He's also on Github by the name [`mtytel`](https://github.com/mtytel). Check him out as he has other great open-source projects as well!

I use this by linking directly the `User/` directory:
```
ln -s $PWD/User ~Music/Vital/User
```

Enjoy!
